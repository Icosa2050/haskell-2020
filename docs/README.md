## Course Description

Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a
strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. It is
being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook,
AT\&T, and NASA, along with several financial firms. We will explore the
joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. In the first
part of the course, you will learn to use Haskell to easily and
conveniently write practical programs. The last couple of weeks will
consist of several special topics that explore advanced features of
Haskell. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly
programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.

## Getting the Software

You can find instructions on how to install the necessary software [here](https://github.com/zfoh/haskell-simple-install/blob/master/README.md).

## Lectures

## Assignments

Homework is due at midnight at the end of the day listed.
All homework submission is via GitHub classrom.

## Tests

Every two weeks there will be a little exam.
Don't worry, it's the same technique as the homeworks,
the only difference is that here the time windows is shorter and that you will work alone, not in a team.

## How to get help

Students portal
Is the first source of information. Here you will find
lecture, notes, exercises, etc.
Visit it in: [haskell-mongolia-2020](https://github.com/iohkedu/haskell-mongolia-2020)

Class Questions
Questions like:

- How do I install Haskell on Windows?
- Which text editor should I use?
- What is a Cabal Package?
It should go in: [Stackoverflow IohkEdu](https://stackoverflow.com/c/iohkedu/questions)
On stackoverflow team students are *encouraged* to answer each others questions.

[Alejandro Garcia](alejandro.garcia@iohk.io) will monitor the forum closely
so that we don't let questions go unanswered.

Defects
If you found a defect in one of the sample programs.
Or maybe a typo in one of the slides we will really appreciate it
if you could post it as an issue on GitHub Itself.

## Course Description

Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a
strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. It is
being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook,
AT\&T, and NASA, along with several financial firms. We will explore the
joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. In the first
part of the course, you will learn to use Haskell to easily and
conveniently write practical programs. The last couple of weeks will
consist of several special topics that explore advanced features of
Haskell. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly
programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.

## Getting the Software

You can find instructions on how to install the necessary software [here](https://github.com/zfoh/haskell-simple-install/blob/master/README.md).

## Lectures

## Assignments

Homework is due at midnight at the end of the day listed.
All homework submission is via GitHub classrom.

## Tests

Every two weeks there will be a little exam.
Don't worry, it's the same technique as the homeworks,
the only difference is that here the time windows is shorter and
that you will work alone, not in a team.

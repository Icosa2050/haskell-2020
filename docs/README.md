## Course Description

Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a
strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. It is
being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook,
AT\&T, and NASA, along with several financial firms. We will explore the
joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. In the first
part of the course, you will learn to use Haskell to easily and
conveniently write practical programs. The last couple of weeks will
consist of several special topics that explore advanced features of
Haskell. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly
programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.

## Tests

Every two weeks there will be a little exam.
Don't worry it's the same tecnique as the homeworks
the only difference is that here the time windows is shorter.
